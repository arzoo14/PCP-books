    - SCALABLE TIME SERIES
  summary: >-
    Performs a time series query for either matching identifiers, or matching
    identifiers with series of time-stamped values.
  description: >
    The query is in the format described in
    [pmseries](https://pcp.io/man/man1/pmseries.1.html)(1) and is passed to the
    server via either the *expr* parameter (HTTP GET) or via the message body
    (HTTP POST).


    When querying for time series matches only, no time window options are
    specified and matching series identifiers are returned in a JSON array.

    ```

    $ curl -s http://localhost:44322/series/query?expr=disk.dev.read* | pmjson

    ```

    When querying for time series values as well, a time window must be
    specified as part of the query string. The simplest form is to just request
    the most recent sample.

    ```

    $ curl -s http://localhost:44322/series/query?expr=disk.dev.read*[samples:1]
    | pmjson

    ```
