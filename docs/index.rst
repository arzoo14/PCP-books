Performance Co-Pilot Books
###########################

`Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) <https://pcp.io/>`_ provides a framework and services to support system-level performance monitoring and management. It presents a unifying 
abstraction for all of the performance data in a system, and many tools for interrogating, retrieving and processing that data.

PCP is a feature-rich, mature, extensible, cross-platform toolkit supporting both live and retrospective analysis. The distributed PCP architecture 
makes it especially useful for those seeking centralized monitoring of distributed processing.
