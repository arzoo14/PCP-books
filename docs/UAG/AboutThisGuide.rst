About This Guide
################

This guide describes the Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) performance analysis toolkit. PCP provides a systems-level suite of tools 
that cooperate to deliver distributed performance monitoring and performance management services spanning hardware platforms, 
operating systems, service layers, database internals, user applications and distributed architectures.  

PCP is a cross-platform, open source software package - customizations, extensions, source code inspection, and tinkering in general is actively encouraged.  

“About This Guide” includes short descriptions of the chapters in this book, directs you to additional sources of information, and explains typographical conventions.
